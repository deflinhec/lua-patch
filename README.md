# LuaPatch

Lua patch is a utility tool for creating patch between two different Lua variables
with same type. This patch can then be applied to another variable. All number
values, expect table keys, will be caculate and result with a delta offset
within the patch. For string and boolean, values will be update with the
latest value, if there is no different between, patch returns as nil.

It provides three functions:

```lua
local lpatch = require "lpatch"
local clone = lpatch:copy (origin)
```

Shallow copy of the orginal table.

```lua
local lpatch = require "lpatch"
local patch = lpatch:make (origin, clone)
```

Make patch between two tables.

```lua
local lpatch = require "lpatch"
local patched = lpatch:apply (origin, patch)
```

Apply patch to old_table.

# Example
```lua
local print = print
local assert = assert
local utils = require 'utils'
local json = require 'dkjson'
local lpatch = require 'lpatch'

local origin = {
    n = 1.1,
    b = true,
    s = "aaa",
    list = {
        "e1",
    },
    dict = {
        a = "123",
    },
}

-- Make some change to table
local modified = lpatch:copy(origin)
table.insert(modified.list, "e2")
modified.n = modified.n - 1
modified.dict.b = "456"
modified.s = "bbb"
modified.b = false

-- Make patch and apply
local patch = lpatch:make(origin, modified)
local patched = lpatch:apply(origin, patch)
assert(utils:deepcompare(modified, patched))

print(json.encode(patch, {indent = true}))
print(json.encode(origin, {indent = true}))
print(json.encode(patched, {indent = true}))
```

## Patch json layout

```json
{
    "@s#n":-1,
    "@s#dict":{
        "+s#b":"456"
    },
    "@s#s":"bbb",
    "@s#list":{
        "+n#2":"e2"
    },
    "@s#b":false
}
```
